		<h2 id={firstHeadingId}>Code of Conduct</h2>
		<p>
			The Collab Lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
			everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of developers in any form.
		</p>
		<p>
			This code of conduct applies to all Collab Lab spaces, including but not
			limited to our GitHub and Slack teams, both online and off. Anyone who
			violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these
			spaces at the discretion of the RESPONSE TEAM.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some Collab Lab spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be
			made clearly available to developers. Developers are responsible for
			knowing and abiding by these rules.
		</p>
		<p>Harassment includes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression,
				sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality,
				physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.
			</li>
			<li>
				Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices,
				including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and
				employment.
			</li>
			<li>Deliberate misgendering or use of “dead” or rejected names.</li>
			<li>
				Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where
				they’re not appropriate.
			</li>
			<li>
				Physical contact and simulated physical contact (e.g., textual
				descriptions such as “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a
				request to stop.
			</li>
			<li>Threats of violence.</li>
			<li>
				Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a
				person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
			</li>
			<li>Deliberate intimidation.</li>
			<li>Stalking or following.</li>
			<li>
				Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity
				for harassment purposes.
			</li>
			<li>Sustained disruption of discussion.</li>
			<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
			<li>
				Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming
				inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.
			</li>
			<li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.</li>
			<li>
				Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their
				consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from
				intentional abuse.
			</li>
			<li>Publication of non-harassing private communication.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The Collab Lab prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged
			people’s comfort. RESPONSE TEAM reserves the right not to act on
			complaints regarding the following: “Reverse”-isms, including “reverse
			racism,” “reverse sexism,” and “cisphobia”.
		</p>
		<h2>Reporting</h2>
		<p>
			If you are being harassed by a member of The Collab Lab, notice that
			someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact
			the RESPONSE TEAM immediately. If the person who is harassing you is on
			the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will
			respond as promptly as we can.
		</p>
		<p>
			This code of conduct applies to Collab Lab spaces, but if you are being
			harassed by a member of The Collab Lab outside our spaces, we still want
			to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by
			Collab Lab members, especially Founder Andrew Hedges, seriously. This
			includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at
			any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people
			from The Collab Lab based on their past behavior, including behavior
			outside Collab Lab spaces and behavior towards people who are not in The
			Collab Lab.
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the
			right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith.
			Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without
			response.
		</p>
		<p>
			We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting
			victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about
			whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties
			about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of Collab
			Lab members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims
			without their affirmative consent.
		</p>
		<p>You can report violations in the following ways:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Email Stacie Taylor-Cima, Lisa Smith, Michelle Sauque, and Adrienne Lowe
				at
				<a href="mailto:code-of-conduct@the-collab-lab.codes"
					>code-of-conduct@the-collab-lab.codes</a
				>
			</li>
			<li>
				Direct message @stacie, @lisa, @michelle, and/or @adrienne in the Collab
				Lab Slack workspace
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Consequences</h2>
		<p>
			Developers asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
			immediately.
		</p>
		<p>
			If a participant engages in harassing behavior, RESPONSE TEAM may take any
			action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all
			Collab Lab spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to
			other Collab Lab members or the general public.
